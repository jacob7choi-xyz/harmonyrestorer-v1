ML Models Package for HarmonyRestorer

This package contains the core AI models for audio restoration:
- Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs)
- 1D Operational GANs for blind audio restoration
- Loss functions and training utilities

Based on the research paper:
"Blind Restoration of Real-World Audio by 1D Operational GANs"
